NOTE: The field numbers 21 and 22 were explicitly chosen to avoid accidental conflicts with other protobuf message formats used for acknowledgements. The first byte of any message with this format will be the non-ASCII values `0xaa` (result) or `0xb2` (error). Implemented as defined by ICS: https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/master/spec/core/ics-004-channel-and-packet-semantics#acknowledgement-envelope"
